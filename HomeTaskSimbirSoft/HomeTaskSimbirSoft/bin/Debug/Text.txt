Android is an operating system based on the 
Linux kernel, and designed primarily for 
touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones 
and tablet computers. Initially developed by 
Android, Inc, which Google backed financially 
and later bought in 2005, Android was unveiled 
in 2007 along with the founding of the Open Handset 
Alliance: a consortium of hardware, software, and 
telecommunication companies devoted to advancing 
open standards for mobile devices. The first 
publicly available smartphone running Android, 
the HTC Dream, was released on October 22, 2008. 
The user interface of Android is based on direct 
manipulation, using touch inputs that loosely 
correspond to real-world actions, like swiping, 
tapping, pinching and reverse pinching to 
manipulate on-screen objects. Internal hardware 
such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and proximity 
sensors are used by some applications to respond 
to additional user actions, for example adjusting 
the screen from portrait to landscape depending 
on how the device is oriented. Android allows users 
to customize their home screens with shortcuts to 
applications and widgets, which allow users to 
display live content, such as emails and weather 
information, directly on the home screen. Applications 
can further send notifications to the user to inform 
them of relevant information, such as new 
emails and text messages.
